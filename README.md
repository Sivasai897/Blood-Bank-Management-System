# System for Managing Blood Banks
This is a full-fledged style project that includes both frontend and backend development as well as some JAVA-based design. The goal of this project is to establish a modern-looking database for blood donations that is streamlined and efficient.Images, a full report, and an efficient code were all included in the zip file that was uploaded.It also includes a SQL database and some raw data for testing the output.

The following is an analysis of our blood bank management system:-<br/>
● A good blood bank database should make it simple to connect possible donors with blood banks, and blood banks with potential recipients, and vice versa.<br/>
● The potential donors would be matched with a blood bank in their area.<br/>
● Another goal of the database is to register and store blood banks by location so that they can be easily linked to potential donors and recipients.<br/>
● The goal of blood banks is to receive and distribute blood from people in need (recipients) in their immediate vicinity.<br/>
● The blood recipient would need to be linked to a bank that has his blood on hand and is in close proximity to him.<br/>
